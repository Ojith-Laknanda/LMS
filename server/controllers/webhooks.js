CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET: A secret key from your .env file. Only you and Clerk know this, so it keeps your webhooks safe.

wh.verify(...): This checks if the webhook is really from Clerk and not some random hacker.

    type: tells us what happened â€” like user.created, user.updated, or user.deleted

    data: contains info about the user (name, email, image, etc.)
